This is my mini capstone project or PDX Code Guild's python section. 

The purpose of this lab is to run statistical analysis on data. It uses an API to create fake test subjects, then assigns them to 2 groups. They are then assigned a weight in kilograms using a simple formula to give a roughly normal distribution. The weights are based off of the average human male and female. 

The tests that can currently be used are Independent t-test, Paired t-test, and One-Sample t-test. The program does not yet provide any visual output other than raw numbers, and users still must compare t-scores with a chart to determine statistical significance.

Stretch goals for this program are more tests, the ability to pull in data from spreadsheets, visualization of data, and an output for significance and effect size without the need to consult a chart.
