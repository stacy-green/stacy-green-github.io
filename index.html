About Me – People want to know who you are, so make sure your portfolio includes some detail about that. Include your name, a photo, and a short blurb about what you’ve done and where you hope to go in your career. It’s a good idea to refine this narrative over time as your career progresses. Developing your brand story takes time, but it’s a unique asset that you can nurture to help your career grow.
Projects – The critical component of any programming portfolio will be home to the very best samples of your work. This section should be as captivating as possible, so get creative with videos, GIFs, and eye-catching web design and copy.
Contact Me – Without this, you could be hurting your chances of getting job offers. Ideally, you should include a contact form and your social media channels. If you don’t do that, at the bare minimum, add your email address plus links to your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
