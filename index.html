            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Although new to programming, I'm not new to computers. My parents tried to prevent me from using the home computer when I was 7 by taking away the mouse, so I learned to work around it with Windows 95 keyboard shortcuts and command prompt. I have a minor background in engineering and computer science; I've taken classes on digital electronics, Javascript, and I'm currently enrolled in a Fullstack Bootcamp. However, my major background is in Psychology, which translates surprisingly well to computer sciences. After all, code is written by humans, and understanding the humans that write code gives insight into troubleshooting. Coding comes naturally to me because I'm multilingual; it is simply using the correct language to communicate with a machine. I also have a background in Military Intelligence, and began my journey into coding at the advice of a former coworker who is currently employed in the cyber-security field.

                My hobbies include storytelling, writing, traveling, and crafts. Most of what I write is for tabletop role-playing games, focused on surreal horror; nothing highlights the ability to think outside the box quite like receiving a mug of liquified "concept of time" by a giant anthropomorphic mosquito, who drew it from the veins of the tentacle-legged bartender permanently attached to the living tavern you are sitting in. Travel has led me to reassess how I view communication; the concept of syntax in a programming language makes a lot more sence when you've spoken in a language that eschews syntax and grammar. I make chainmail by hand; my largest project to date is a steel necktie in a dragonscale pattern. Most of my crafts are pride themed and rely heavily on chains. The focus and detail orientation that comes with chain-making is a skill that lends well to coding.
